title: Dads camp
---

## When?

Friday (arrive after lunchtime) 28th of April to Monday the *1st of May*, 2023. 

The campsite is open at that time, so you can arrive whenever you like but you will need to pay the owner for any extra nights.

## Where?

Buckshead farm campsite, B4070, Gloucester GL4 8HG
<a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Buckshead+Farm+Campsite/@51.8137556,-2.1294084,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x487111f1627b3d45:0x69a575c5b3b6feb5!8m2!3d51.8137523!4d-2.1272144)" target="_blank">Directions</a>  

## Our aim?

Meaningful meetings between men, whilst having fun with our children. The aim will be to create a ‘village’ feel, and there is space for a couple of camper van/caravans on the edge (let us know if you are bringing one). There will be some communal cooking; although not on the scale of previous years as this campsite doesn’t have kitchen facilities. We will be in touch nearer the time via email to let you know exactly what the catering provision will be. Everyone will be expected to sign up for the rota of cooking, washing up and other jobs on site. 

## What will we do?
Dads are welcome to bring an activity. Dads who have been before will tell you that this is a special feature of the weekend.

## Activities

TODO

## How many dads?

Max number of Dads is 33. First come first served. We always reserve five spaces for guys who haven’t been before, and for the "Core Group", (currently 7 men) who meet to arrange things before camp. If you are interested in becoming a core group member next year then you will be able to get in touch with any of us at camp - we're looking for new members. 


At the moment the core group are:
Arthur Edwards
Miles Guerinni
Freddie Janke
Ben Jarlett
Joe Jarlett
Andy Kane
Creag Louttit-Vermaat

## Do you have a friend who wants to come?

At the moment of writing we only have very few space spaces, if you know someone who wants to come you are welcome send them this info but get them to join the waiting list

## How much?
Your contribution of £85 to cover the costs of this year's camp and safeguard the possibility of another great camp in 2023. It does include the cost of the food offered. No-one earns any money from the camp. You can pay what you feel if £85 is a problem. We are not intending to make any profit, but we do want to have £400 surplus from what is sent to us which we expect to use as a 2023 deposit for next years camp. Any surplus left on top of that may be used at the discretion of next year’s core group to be spent on next year's camp.
